                        My name is Bradley Newlon, and I'm a software engineer from Parkersburg, West Virginia. I have been described as a strong self-starter. What I am best at, however, is learning quickly because 
                        of my curious nature. I have always enjoyed learning about new ideas and skills regardless of the topic, which I believe my experience illustrates. I majored in Economics, but I have a lot 
                        of training, both formal and informal, in programming.

                            I started my programming journey when I was around 14 years old when I bought a book on C# with birthday money I had saved. Admittedly, I don't remember much C#,
                            but my passion for programming started here. From my own self-teaching and formal Computer Science education at WVU, I've become proficient in numerous programming languages.
                            The languages I am most comfortable with are the following (not including HTML and CSS):
                            <ul>
                                <li>Java</li>
                                <li>Python</li>
                                <li>Javascript</li>
                                <li>C</li>
                                <li>PHP</li>
                                <li>R</li>
                                <li>SQL</li>

                        </p>

                            In terms of operating systems, I am comfortable with Linux, Unix, and Windows. I am also comfortable using Microsoft Office, Git, AWS, and Digital Ocean.

                                    Since August 2021, I've been employed at Memorial Health System in Marietta, Ohio as a web developer in the marketing department. I am the sole developer. I maintain their current website and create new sites as needed for events and such. While I've been employed at MHS, I've also worked on their telehealth app Memorial Care Now, and I've created an internal web app for the marketing department to create simple flyers.

                                    I started building Recipeze in January 2020. The website is designed to shorten user's grocery lists by recommending recipes that have ingredients in common with the recipe the user 
                                    is currently viewing. Recipeze was deployed in June 2020, and stayed in production until around January 2022. Recipeze was hosted with Digital Ocean, the frontend is built with React, 
                                    the backend with Django, Nginx is used as a reverse proxy, and Recipeze uses PostgreSQL as the database. The code for the frontend is publicly available on

                                    While at WVU, I also created a number of other projects for classes.

                                    In Summer 2019 I was selected to participate in WVU's Summer Undergraduate Research Experience (SURE). The SURE program was a summer program where participants conducted research guided 
                                    by a mentor. I was fortunate enough to be mentored by <a href="http://alex-lundberg-economics.com/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alexander Lundberg</a>, 
                                    who was also my academic advisor for a time. At Professor Lundberg's guidance I researched the economic performance of dark web drug markets. Specifically, researched how

                                    During my research, I made extensive use of Python and R for web scraping and statistical analysis.

                                    At the beginning of the Fall 2019 Semester I was selected to be a Neidermeyer Scholar at WVU's John Chambers School of Business and Economics. As a Neidermeyer Scholar I was required to
                                    sit in on a principles of microeconomics course (ECON 201). For the students in my assigned course I led and organized out of class group supplemental instruction sessions based on where 
                                    the students were in the course. I also offered office hours where students could drop in and ask any other questions they had about the course content. 
                                    I was a Neidermeyer Scholar for five semesters and during this time I provided supplemental instruction for five courses and helped countless students.
